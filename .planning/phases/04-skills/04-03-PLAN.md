  <what-built>Skills surfaced to Telegram: command registration, CLI installer, skill-creator auto-install</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
## Pre-Flight

1. Build and start gateway:
   ```bash
   npm run build && npm run gateway
   ```
2. Check logs for "skill-creator installed" or skill registration

## Test 1: Telegram Command Menu

1. In Telegram, type `/`
2. Verify `skill_creator` appears in the command menu
3. Verify `/skill` command appears

**Expected:** skill-creator visible in / menu

## Test 2: Skill Invocation

1. Send `/skill_creator` (or `/skill skill-creator`)
2. Claude should respond with skill-creator flow (asking what skill to create)

**Expected:** Claude enters skill creation mode

## Test 3: CLI Skills Manager

1. In terminal:
   ```bash
   node dist/index.js skills
   ```
2. Should show skill-creator as installed

**Expected:** skill-creator listed

## Test 4: Claude Uses Skills Naturally

1. If you have other skills installed, test that Claude uses them
2. Or ask Claude "what skills do you have available?"

**Expected:** Claude is aware of installed skills

## Results

- [ ] Test 1: Commands in menu
- [ ] Test 2: skill-creator works
- [ ] Test 3: CLI lists skills
- [ ] Test 4: Claude aware of skills
