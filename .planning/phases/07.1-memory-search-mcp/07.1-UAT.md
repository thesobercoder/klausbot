## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Bot Startup with Migration
expected: Bot starts without errors. Migration runs silently if legacy embeddings.json exists.
result: pass

### 2. Search Memories Tool Available
expected: When chatting with bot, Claude can call `search_memories` MCP tool. Ask bot "what did we discuss about [some past topic]?" and it should search semantically.
result: pass

### 3. Search Results Format
expected: Search results show numbered list with match percentage and date. Example: "[1] (85% match, 1/29/2026) - conversation excerpt..."
result: issue
reported: "Not seeing logs related to memory search, infact all mcp tool calls should be logged"
severity: major

### 4. Date Filtering Works
expected: Ask bot to search recent conversations (e.g., "what did we talk about yesterday?"). Results should be scoped to recent days.
result: pass
