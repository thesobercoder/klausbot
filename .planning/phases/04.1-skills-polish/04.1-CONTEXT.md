# Phase 4.1: Skills Polish - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-29
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Address skill system gaps identified during Phase 4 UAT: system prompt reminder about skill folder location, and CLI skill registry browsing/installation. No new skill execution features — polish only.

</domain>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

### System Prompt Wording

- Always present in every system prompt
- Top of system prompt — first thing Claude sees
- Location only: just mention `~/.claude/skills/`
- Minimal: remind Claude to use skills and save them there, nothing more
- No enumeration of installed skills in prompt

### Registry Source & Curation

- Start with Anthropic official skills only (like skill-creator)
- Hardcoded list in klausbot code — no remote manifest fetching
- Flat list, no categories
- Show "update available" indicator when installed skill has newer version

### CLI Browse Experience

- Command: `klausbot skills browse`
- Interactive list navigation (arrow keys, enter to select)
- Type-to-filter for real-time narrowing
- Confirm before install: show details, ask "install?", then proceed

### Skill Metadata Display

- List view: name + one-liner description
- Confirmation view: description + slash commands it provides
- Installed skills marked with ✓ checkmark badge
- Update available marked with ↑ arrow icon

### Claude's Discretion

- Exact interactive list library choice (inquirer, prompts, etc.)
- System prompt exact wording
- Version comparison logic for update detection

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Interactive experience should feel like `npm init` — smooth arrow key navigation
- Keep the confirmation step lightweight — don't need full README, just enough to decide

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
